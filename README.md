# Resources and information for international students in the U.S. (focused on Georgia Tech students)

The number of international students has reached a new record high[^1] after a pandemic-related dip. More than 6800 international students were enrolled at GT in Georgia for the 2024/25 academic year.
The Trump administration's executive orders, policies and process changes [^2][^3] have created considerable anxiety among the international acdemic community concerning travel and reentry into the United States, visa status, and the risk of non-citizens being questioned and detained.

This repository collects information and links to resources for international students to understand requirements, prepare and implement best practices, and enable informed decisions. Please consider contributing additional information through a PR, an issue, or by sending me an [email](mailto:alexander.lerch@gatech.edu).

## General info and resources

## Revoked visas
The number of revoked visas and terminations of legal status has been risen in recent days[^4][^5][^6] and the official [OIE pages](https://isss.oie.gatech.edu/content/visa-revocation) are only somewhat helpful. [This document](https://pennstatelaw.psu.edu/sites/default/files/newFact%20sheet%20for%20international%20students%20FINAL%20VERSION%5B63%5D.pdf) provides more legal background on this matter. Multiple law suits have been filed [^7] and a temporary restraining order granted.[^8] Students with revoked visas should seek [legal advice](https://isss.oie.gatech.edu/content/seeking-legal-consultation-us) immediately.



## Travel and reentry
There have been news reports of [increased scrutiny](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/trump-immigration-detained-visitors-border-search-device-visa-passport-rcna197736) that arriving travelers face, ranging from device searches to unexpected detentions and visa revocations. Thus, international students should always carry a complete set of necessary documents without discrepancies (e.g., passport, visa, I-20, copy of transcript or EAD), carefully asses the risk, and prepare for all eventualities. Evidence of previous (minor) legal infractions or political activism could potentially raise red flags with the immigration officer. An EFF guide to [digital privacy at the border](https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017#part-3) provides extensive information and tips for preparation for crossing the border. 

The [OIE page](https://isss.oie.gatech.edu/content/travel) states: "If you have any issues upon re-entering at the U.S. port of entry outside of normal office hours and need immediate assistance, please contact Georgia Tech Campus Police [404-894-2500](tel:4048942500). An on-call OIE contact (DSO/ARO) will be available to speak with Customs and Border Patrol agents."
